Thanks to the user inq720 from the forum https://forums.raspberrypi.com/ for the idea to simply patch the binary.  
**No thank** to the users of many Python Forums, where I asked for help, since I have practically no experience with Python.  
They spent pages trying to discourage me of doing what I have done, and kept telling me to "read the tutorials" when I just needed some examples to start with the unknown syntax.
